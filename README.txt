ABSTRACT:
Punchclock is a series of scripts that records user login and logout of KDE, and coverts that information into iCalendar files. Punchclock consists of two python scripts. The script punchin.py records the KDE login event. The script punchout.py does all the hard work. It takes the data generated by punchin.py and the current datetime and creates an iCalendar event. It then adds this event to a valid iCalendar file, creating one if one does not exist. The raw login/logout data is stored ina separate file as a backup and a check against the ics file.

INSTALLATION:
