DESCRIPTION:
Punchclock is a series of scripts that records user login and logout of KDE, and coverts that information into iCalendar files. Punchclock consists of two python scripts. The script punch-in.py records the KDE login event. The script punch-out.py does all the hard work: it takes the data generated by punch-in.py and the current datetime and creates an iCalendar event corresponding to the duration of the user's KDE session. It then adds this event to a valid iCalendar file, creating one if one does not exist. Additionally, the raw login/logout data is stored in a separate text file as a backup and a check against the ics file.

INSTALLATION:
