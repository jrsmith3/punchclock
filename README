This is the prototype version of punchclock. Right now it consists of two python scripts: one records the kdm login time, the other records the kdm logout time and adds it to an icalendar file containing the history of logins and logouts.

There are still some issues with these files:
* It seems possible to completely wipe out the history file (punchclock.ics). Perhaps I should consider using a simpler text file, then parsing that file (e.g. how I have things set up with date >> /path/to/file/punchclock.txt)
* No unit tests
* Source needs to be cleaned up a bit, I can probably come up with better variable names.
* All of the paths are hard-coded into the file
* I need to add timezone info.
